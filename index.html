    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I’m an aspiring Front-End Developer with a love for building things from
      scratch and seeing my ideas come to life on screen. The creative process
      of coding, mixed with the immediate feedback you get from web development,
      is what really excites me. I enjoy working with detail, organizing things
      visually, and learning at my own pace. I’m currently growing my tech
      skillset while aiming for a flexible, hybrid career where creativity meets
      structure and autonomy.
